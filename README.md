# MonteCarlo-Uncertainty
This R script and VBA macro Excel show the estimation of uncertainty by the Monte Carlo simulation applied to an example of total organic carbon (TOC) analysis in water. This method is based on generating values according to defined distributions, computing the measurement model, and then calculating the standard deviation of the output.
